# Feature Support

MatchID builds user onboarding and wallet infrastructure to enable better products built on crypto rails. MatchID offers a React SDK and a server-to-server API to easily onboard users, help them connect their wallets or provision new self-custodial embedded wallets for them. The latter and former support using MatchID in various app frameworks and clients.

# Authentication

MatchID is built to onboard every user onto your app, regardless of their digital literacy. MatchID supports the login methods your users are comfortable using, enabling your application to meet them where they are. Your application can stand up a login flow out of the box in minutes or build your own custom flow using MatchID SDK. Once a user is authenticated, MatchID will seamlessly create a wallet for them behind the scenes.

Your app can also use MatchID to prompt users to link additional accounts at any point in their user journey, not just during login. This is key to MatchID's progressive onboarding: improving conversion and UX by requiring users to complete onboarding steps only when necessary.

The fastest way to integrate MatchID is with the MatchID login modal. Your application can integrate this modal in just a few lines of code and easily toggle on login methods for your application in the MatchID dashboard.

## Wallet

MatchID allows your application to use External Wallets for authentication. MatchID's external wallet login feature is fully-compatible with any external wallet. If your wish to login with your current wallets, MatchID is easily integrable with your existing stack.

## Google

MatchID allows your application to use Google for authentication. MatchID's embedded wallets are fully-compatible with any authentication provider that supports JWT-based, stateless authentication. If your application already uses an auth provider and you're looking to add embedded wallets to your app, MatchID is easily integrable with your existing stack.
